Eric Adams spends coldest night of year at new NYC migrant shelter. Mayor Eric Adams tried to fend off criticism over accommodations at the new emergency migrant shelter in Brooklyn by staying there overnight during the coldest day of the year.  “We are going to stay tonight with our brothers here and just let them know that we are all in this together,” said Adams, while playing video games late Friday with one of the hundreds of migrant men staying at the converted Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. Some progressive pols, including Councilman Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn), contended the new Red Hook accommodations are not very welcoming after a recent tour. Adams, who declared a state of emergency over the migrant crisis in October, has said it will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion to provide the migrant population — now 44,000 and counting — with shelter and other services.

Mayor Eric Adams of New York City recently spent the coldest night of the year at the new emergency migrant shelter in Brooklyn, in an effort to demonstrate his commitment to helping the migrant population. Adams declared a state of emergency over the migrant crisis in October, and the shelter is one of many steps he has taken to provide shelter and other services to the estimated 44,000 migrants in the city. 

The new shelter has been met with some criticism, primarily from progressive politicians like Councilman Lincoln Restler, who took a tour of the facility and found it to be less than welcoming. Adams countered this criticism by spending the night there, playing video games with the migrants and making sure that they knew that he was there for them. 

The estimated cost for providing services to the migrants is approximately $2 billion, and Adams has been working to ensure that those funds are being used in the most effective manner. His overnight stay at the shelter was a sign of his commitment to the city's migrant population, and a reminder that they are not alone in their struggles.
